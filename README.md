# MNIST 
This repository conists of two classifiers for the MNIST data set. The first (MNIST DNN) uses a dense fully connected network and the second (Le Net 5) implemented with a convolutional (LeNet) architecture with random data augmentations. Scikit-learn wrapper classes were created to simplify hyper-parameter tuning and scoring.
